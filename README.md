# DTCC-Dashboard
a Web-based application built in PHP
I got fed up of trying to manage a virtual company using Spreadsheets, so I have created a Webapp that our supervisors can use to:
-Read and sign Applications from players to work with the company
-Complete training procedures for recruits
-View contact information for employees
-Assign strikes, dismissals and bans from the company
-Collect and verify Shift Data
-Manage employees and track their activity

#This WebApp is currently in use on the Highlife Roleplay community on FiveM

# DTCC-Dashboard

This project is currently a work-in-progress. I have decided to host it Publicly for the benefit of all. 
I am not a PHP web developer, the very existence of this project is purely for education purposes.

That being said, Highlife Roleplay's Downtown Cab Co are using a live version of this interface to manage our company in-game.

Feel free to use any of this code for your own purpose, create as many forks as you like.
If you are able to learn a thing or two about basic PHP and SQL using this code then good for you. I am happy.

# This is NOT a finished project.

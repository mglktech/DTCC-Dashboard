Hello T2-17 | Hugo Olsen.
We've seen your activity decline steadily over the past month.
As a result of this underperformance, we have decided to relegate you to the rank of Driver once again.
Drivers are expected to clock in for a minimum of **Two Hours** per month, and we would normally expect significantly more activity from private hire. 
We hope that you can continue to work with us.
Kind regards
